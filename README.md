This project aims to use various methods to predict review ratings on a dataset of Amazon reviews about Outdoor, Gardening and Patio products. We use a rule-based method powered by VADER and three machine learning methods.
SVM, Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes.

We are aiming to reduce the ammount of 5-star reviews as this suggests a product is perfect. The issue with this is that the text of a 5-star review may contain negative sentiment which would mean the product is not perfect.

We have outlined multiple methods and compared the results in Results.ipynb. We also are able to compare the methods on user input reviews in Generating Ratings.ipynb.

Overall, SVM preformed the best for our task.
